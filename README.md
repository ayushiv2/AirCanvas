# AirCanvas

This is a computer vision application that allows the user to draw on a canvas using different colours. It uses a webcam to capture the video feed and tracks the movement of a colour marker on the screen. The user can adjust the colour of the marker using trackbars. Different arrays are used to handle different colour points, and a kernel is used for dilation purposes. The program allows the user to select different colours and clear the canvas. The canvas and colour buttons are displayed on the screen using rectangles and text. The program uses OpenCV and NumPy libraries for image processing and manipulation.
